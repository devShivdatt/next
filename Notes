Next js features - 
1> Full stack app - frontend & backend in same app.
2> Routes are configured via file system
3> SSR - By default next js (pre) renders all pages on server side.

Key Points - 
- App routes vs page router
- "metadata" is the reserved kayword & page.js, layout.js, error.js, not-found.js are reserver file names in next js
- params added by next js
- Params is promise after next 15 so use await
